# [Flossy's Clothing][website]

### What is it?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a react based website for a fictional Clothing Line, Flossy's Clothing. I tried my best to simplify it as possible and if you are familiar with components you will be able to find your way around easily.

It:
  - Heavily uses Flexbox and CSS Grid
  - No Bootstrap, Materialize or any other CSS Frameworks/Libraries were uses
